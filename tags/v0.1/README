WHAT IS MOODLEPLUGIN

MoodlePlugin is a plugin class for Moodle which enables you to get and store information directly on Moodle database. The SOAP interface we developed infact offers the methods to remotely import/export users, courses and courses categories.

REQUIREMENTS

In order to get MoodlePlugin functioning you MUST have PHP5 on your web server with SOAP and XSL support enabled.

HOW TO INSTALL

To install and get it operative you only have to put the files you found in the packageinto your Moodle main directory.
Then open moodleplugin.wsdl and replace "www.myserver.com/moodle" with your domain and that's it: you will have a soap server which is listening on port 443 and which you can connect to.


HOW TO USE

To use the SOAP interface you have to create a SOAP client like the sample one you can find in the package, which is a PHP script. You can see which methods are available by accessing the SOAP server directly from your browser (servesoap.php); then you can use them directly from the SOAP client you made up, accordingly with the interface which is described in "moodleplugin.php".

All the files contained in this package are licensed with GPLv2, but we're looking for a way to restrict military uses on them. We may change our license policy in next releases, mantaining the most essential open source features to achieve our goal.
 
TODO
The work on MoodlePlugin class is still in progress: we need  to implement an easy way to interactively configure the parameters which are passed to the script.
